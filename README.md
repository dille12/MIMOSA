# MIMOSA

**MIMOSA** (Microscopy IMage prOcessing SoftwAre) is a **node-based image analysis toolkit** for dispersion accurate measurements **SEM images**. It provides a modular framework for **particle detection**, **dispersion analysis**, and **morphological quantification**, optimized for large image batches and research on **rubber–lignin composites**.

---

## Features
- Node-based visual pipeline for image processing  
- High-performance backend using **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **OpenCV**, **scikit-image**, and **Numba**  
- Real-time GUI built with **Pygame**
- Builtin support for **TensorFlow** semantic segmentation models
- Tools for thresholding, segmentation, and morphological analysis  
- Designed for **SEM images** and **particle dispersion studies**
